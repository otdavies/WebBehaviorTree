The term \n\"operation\" more accurately describes the undo/redo actions performed \non the editor state.\n\nChanges:\n- Rename Command.ts to Operation.ts\n- Update Command interface to Operation interface\n- Update CommandHistory class to OperationHistory class\n- Rename all Action classes (AddNodeAction -> AddNodeOperation, etc.)\n- Update all references throughout the codebase\n- Update documentation and comments to reflect new terminology\n\nThis is a pure refactoring with no functional changes - all behavior \nremains identical.\n\nGenerated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
