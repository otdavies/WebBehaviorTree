# Unity Port - Executive Summary

**Task:** Port WebBehaviorTree to Unity Graph Toolkit

**Status:** ✅ Research Complete - Implementation Ready

---

## Quick Answer

**Yes, this is highly feasible and a good idea.**

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 weeks  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium  
**Code Reduction:** ~24% less code than web version  

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Unity Graph Toolkit is Perfect for This

Unity's GraphView provides:
- ✅ Node rendering (automatic)
- ✅ Connection rendering (automatic)
- ✅ Zoom/Pan/Drag (automatic)
- ✅ Selection (automatic)
- ✅ Undo/redo support

**Result:** ~1,500 lines of code eliminated compared to web version.

### 2. No Monaco Editor Integration Needed

**Critical Design Decision:** Don't embed a code editor.

Instead:
- User creates C# ActionNode subclasses
- Double-click opens script in Visual Studio/Rider
- Unity handles everything

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full IDE support (IntelliSense, debugging, refactoring)
- ✅ Type-safe at compile time
- ✅ Professional workflow
- ✅ ~500 LOC eliminated

### 3. Clean Architecture Mapping

```
Web TypeScript          →    Unity C#
────────────────             ─────────────────
TreeNode (class)      →    TreeNode (ScriptableObject)
BehaviorTree (class)  →    BehaviorTree (MonoBehaviour)
Blackboard (class)    →    Blackboard (ScriptableObject)
Canvas API            →    GraphView (built-in)
Monaco Editor         →    ❌ Not needed!
localStorage          →    ScriptableObject assets
CSS                   →    USS (similar syntax)
```

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Spike (2-3 days)
**Goal:** Validate the approach

Create minimal prototype:
1. Create Unity project
2. Setup assembly definitions
3. Create 1 composite node (Sequence)
4. Create basic GraphView
5. Test save/load

**Go/No-Go Decision:** If successful, proceed to full implementation.

### Phase 2: Vertical Slice (1 week)
**Goal:** End-to-end working system

Build one complete feature:
1. Sequence + Action nodes (runtime)
2. GraphView editor with these nodes
3. Save/load to ScriptableObject
4. Execute in play mode

**Success Criteria:** Can build and run a simple tree.

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (6-8 weeks)
**Goal:** Production-ready system

Week 1-3: Runtime foundation
- All node types
- Blackboard system
- Execution loop
- Unit tests

Week 4-6: Editor foundation
- Full GraphView features
- Node creation/connection
- Serialization
- USS styling

Week 7-8: Polish
- Undo/redo
- Blackboard panel
- Documentation
- Example scenes

### Phase 4: Iteration (2-3 weeks)
**Goal:** Production quality

- User testing
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization
- Final documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks (Low-Medium)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| GraphView learning curve | Start with spike, use Unity samples |
| Runtime→Editor communication | Use ScriptableObject events |
| Serialization issues | Use Unity's built-in, test early |
| Performance with large graphs | Profile early, spatial partitioning if needed |

### Schedule Risks (Low)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Underestimated complexity | Add 20% buffer, weekly tracking |
| Unity API changes | Target LTS version (2022.3+) |
| Scope creep | Stick to MVP, prioritize ruthlessly |

**Overall Risk:** Low-Medium - Manageable with proper planning.

## Example: Creating a Custom Action

### Web Version
```typescript
// User writes JavaScript in Monaco editor
actionNode.code = `
    const agent = blackboard.get('agent');
    agent.moveToTarget(target);
    return NodeStatus.RUNNING;
`;
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ No type checking until runtime
- ❌ No IntelliSense
- ❌ No debugging
- ❌ No refactoring support

### Unity Version
```csharp
// User creates C# script: MoveToTargetAction.cs
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "AI/Actions/Move To Target")]
public class MoveToTargetAction : ActionNode
{
    [SerializeField] private float speed = 5f;
    
    protected override NodeStatus OnExecute(Blackboard blackboard)
    {
        var agent = blackboard.Get<NavMeshAgent>("agent");
        var target = blackboard.Get<Transform>("target");
        
        agent.SetDestination(target.position);
        
        return agent.remainingDistance > 0.5f 
            ? NodeStatus.Running 
            : NodeStatus.Success;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full type checking at compile time
- ✅ IntelliSense suggests methods
- ✅ Can set breakpoints
- ✅ Refactoring works
- ✅ Serialized fields in inspector
